Project Two of CSCI 370

The name of your game:
    Escape the Island

The intent of your game:<br>
    Find the boat located somewhere on the edge of the map.

Narrative structure:<br>
    You're on an island, a talking parrot explains to you how to escape.

Mechanics:<br>
    Keyboard to move, collisions keep player in bounds, dialogue

Aesthetics:<br>
    2D, topdown, tile based game with a subtle pirate theme. Dialogue appears on screen when approaching key elements, the escape boat makes wave sounds when you interact with it, the parrot will flip to face you, and use of particle system for campefire. 
    
Joys and struggles while writing this game:<br>

    - Joys: Playing with the tiles was fun, having creative freedom with level design, it was easy to make the game look good.
    
    - Struggles: Merge. Conflicts. They did eventually get resolved, but it did cause a big set back. It was also a little bit tedious when doing the collision work to make sure every little detail in the settings was correct, ended up needing a check list for it.

A paragraph discussing the contributions of each team member to the final game: <br>
    Gabby set up the tiles, tilemap, palette, and designed the map, added the follow cam, player sprite, player movements, escape boat sound, and campfire particles. Amelia implemented the parrot, movement of the parrot, the entire dialogue system, custom font, most of the game manager, event system, game replayability. Gabby did most of the initalizing of the project, we worked together/ back and fourth for the middle of it, and Amelia handled some of the last minute ending bits and the game uploading.
